Pubmed's autocomplete function was identified in the following way.

1. Using Chrome, go to Pubmed website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)
2. Display "Developer tools" (press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to "Network" tab.
3. Type query in the Pubmed search box. In the "Network" tab, check "Name" and "initiator" tabs.
	- "Network" tab shows partial URL for the query. To retrieve full URL, right-click on it, click "Copy" and then click "Copy Link Address".
	- "initiator" tab shows the JavaScript involved in this.
*The same info can be checked from "Console" tab if "Log XMLHttpRequests" is checked in Chrome settings.
